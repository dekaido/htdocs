# Stubs: "Penn State Student Clubs"
#### Our project initiated at HackPSU: https://devpost.com/software/htdocs

## Inspiration
EdTech's challenge to make some aspect of education in people's lives easier and Hobson's challenge to use the Starfish database.

## What it does
We are rebranding the student orgs by redesigning a more user-friendly UI and new data analysis for the convenience of the students based on information provided from Starfish.

## How we built it
We utilized the Starfish database to create personalized user profiles corresponding to each unique ID. These profiles were displayed using HTML5. 

## Challenges we ran into
Considering our group size, it proved fairly difficult to split the work in an efficient manner, especially considering we had to learn the programming languages as we were developing.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully working with and manipulating a database and having it link up to a webpage.

## What we learned
PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS

## What's next for Stub
The web application will optimistically be used as a replacement for the current Penn State Student Organizations webpage. With more resources, further plans include opting for an e-mail list for each club, maintaining a list of current clubs involved, and having student organizations recommended based on user preferences.
